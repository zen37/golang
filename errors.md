In the specific examples you provided, the benefits of using `fmt.Errorf` over returning raw errors might not be immediately apparent, especially if the errors are simple and self-explanatory. However, the benefits of using `fmt.Errorf` become clearer in more complex scenarios. Here's a detailed comparison based on the provided examples:

### Examples of Using `fmt.Errorf`

1. **Original Code with `fmt.Errorf`:**
   ```go
   constraint, err := semver.NewConstraint(constraintStr)
   if err != nil {
       return "", fmt.Errorf("invalid constraint: %w", err)
   }
   ```

   **Benefits:**
   - **Contextual Information:** If the error was due to an invalid constraint format, the error message `"invalid constraint: @16.13.0"` is clearer, indicating what went wrong.
   - **Error Wrapping:** The `%w` allows you to preserve the original error, making it possible to inspect or unwrap the original error if needed later.

2. **Error Handling with Raw Error:**
   ```go
   constraint, err := semver.NewConstraint(constraintStr)
   if err != nil {
       return "", err
   }
   ```

   **Drawbacks:**
   - **Lack of Context:** The error message might be less descriptive. It would be more challenging to understand the context of the error without additional information.
   - **No Error Wrapping:** You lose the ability to wrap the original error and provide additional context, making it harder to inspect or handle specific errors in the future.

### When `fmt.Errorf` is Particularly Beneficial:

- **Complex Error Handling:**
  - When dealing with multiple layers of function calls or errors that need detailed context, wrapping errors with `fmt.Errorf` helps trace the problem through the stack.

- **Error Inspection:**
  - If your application uses error handling functions like `errors.Is` or `errors.As` to check for specific error types, wrapping errors with `fmt.Errorf` provides more precise control over error handling.

- **User-Friendly Error Messages:**
  - For end-users or API clients, providing clear and informative error messages improves the user experience and helps them understand what went wrong.

### Conclusion

In simpler cases where the error message is already descriptive and no additional context is required, using raw errors might seem sufficient. However, `fmt.Errorf` offers benefits in terms of error context, wrapping, and consistency, which can be crucial in more complex or larger codebases. It also aligns with best practices for error handling in Go, where providing detailed and contextual error messages improves code maintainability and debugging.
